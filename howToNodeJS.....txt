1. Usually the basic file on which the app is hosted is named as "App.js" or "server.js"
2. 'http' and 'https' are the basic core modules that help us with requests.
	- 'https' is used to launch a ssl server.
	- 'http' helps us with launching a server, and to send requests to another server
		+ we can have multiple servers communicating with each other.
			-> Example: we can use http to send a requests containing coordinates to google map api and get an address.
		+ to use http, we should first import it like this;
			-> const http = require('http')
				--> require(path) is the method through which we import stuff in node js.
				--> we can name it anythig, but typically we name it as http(module that we are importing)
				--> .require(path). here the path to our code module http is 'http'. If its a path to you own file, we do './<path/filename>'
					---> adding './' at the beginning will look for local files.
					---> ommiting it like requests('http') will look for a global module.
		+ we create a server with http.createServer(requestlistener). This should be stored in a variable(typically called as server)
			-> A request listener is a function that executes for every request that comes.
			-> we can either create a seperate function like:
				--> const rqListener = (req, res)=> {
														console.log("executed!!");
													};
				--> or const server = http.createServer((req,res)=> {
																console.log(req);
																	});
			-> The req and res stands for request and response. These are 2 arguments that a request listener takes.
		+ In order for the server to listen to the requests, we should say: server.listen(3000).
			-> The 3000 is a port number. we can use any port number here.
			-> The listen() function also takes a host name. The default name is Localhost.
			-> At this point, we can run the code. Notice that the code does not end in the terminal because its continuesly listening to requests.
			-> we can open a browser and go to localhost:3000 to see what is happening.

3. Node JS lifecycle and event loop:
	-  The event loop is a noe program that keeps on running as long as there are registered servers to listen to requests.
	-  Therefore our entire code is managed by this event loop. Node js uses this kind of event driven loop.
	-  In order to quit the server, we should say process.exit() inside the requestlistener function. But, typically we do not do this as we want tour server to be up all the time.

4. The request object:
	- The request object is is the object that nodejs received when we went to localhost:3000 from the browser.
	- The request object is a very compliacted object with lots of fields which contain both methods and data.
	- The three important things are url, method and headers. We can get these by:
		+ req.method, req.url, req.headers since our variable for request is req in the request listener.

5. The response: (res is the variable name in the requestlistener)
	- We can set the header through res.setHeader('key','value') --> res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
	- We can send a response through res.write('html code').
	- So the requestlistener can look like this:
		+ const requestlistener = (req, res) => {
											console.log(req.url, req.method, req.headers)
											res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
											res.write('<html>')
											res.write('<head><title>This is stupidest way to send html response</title></head>')
											res.write('<body><h1>I am a stupid response</h1></body>')
											res.write('</html>')
											res.end()
	}
	- This is not the ideal way to write html code. But for now, this will do.
	- customizing response:
		+ we can send a custom response based on the url entered:
			-> First, we get the url through res.url, then, based on the url, we can send an appropriate html code:
				--> const rqListener = (req, res)=> {
													// this just logs these fields
													// console.log(req.url, req.method, req.headers);
													// when the user visits the localhost:3000/, this is what happens
													const myurl = req.url;
													console.log(myurl);
													//This will be true only if the url is a string and if it is equal to a slash
													if (myurl === '/') {
														res.write('<html>');
														res.write('<head><title>form</title></head>');
														res.write('<body><form method="POST" action="/message"><label for="message">Your Message: </label><input type="text" name="message"><button type="submit" value="submit">Send</button></body>');
														res.write('</html>');
														// This is not actually required to return res.end()
														// But, doing so will make sure the code that comes after is not executed
														// Also because no code should come after res.end(). if we dont return, the execution will continue and cause an error
														return res.end();
													}
													res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
													res.write('<html>');
													res.write('<head><title>This is stupidest way to send html response</title></head>');
													res.write('<body><h1>I am a stupid response</h1></body>');
													res.write('</html>');
													res.end();
													// this is to quit the server. But we dont want to do this as we want our server to be up all the time
													// process.exit();
												};

	
	- Redirecting response:
		+ now we want to parse the data that user sensd and store it in a file. The data is obtained from the form that we created before. This was also made to changes the url headeer.
		+ We also want to do this only if the request is a post request.
		+ so first, we add an if statement that confirms if we the request is post and if we are in a aspecified url.
		+ To save the message in a file, we need to import the file system module - fs: rquire('fs').
		+ we will use the fs.writeFileSync('filename', 'text').
		+ res.statusCode is set to 302 as this is the default status code for redirect
		+ The redirected url is also set by setHeader('location', '/') --> here, location is teh current location or the current url
		+ The entire if block is written as follows:
			    if (myurl === '/message' && method === 'POST') {
					fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', 'Dummy');
					res.statusCode = 302; //status code for redirect
					res.setHeader('Location', '/'); //this 'location' is also default http stuff. setHeader is the general way to redirect
					return res.end(); //It is important to do this to avoid executing the code below
				}
																
		+ But now, how do we store a custom message inside message.txt instead of a hardcoded message?
			-> First, we need to get the data from the post request. We had already designed a form that takes a text input. This post request is actually captured in the request object(here it is 'req').
			-> This input data is first converted into a 'stream'. Nodejs processes this stream of data in multiple 'chunks'. (this is especially important if the data is large, such as a file)
			-> Therefore, we need a function to get the stream of chunks of data.
				--> we will create an array to store the body of the data, and use the req.on() method to operate on the request. The .on method takes in 2 arguments - an event, and a function(i.e event handler)
					---> const body = [];
						req.on('data',(chunk) => {
						body.push(chunk);
						console.log('chunk');
						});
				--> Now this body array has the stream of data which is not buffered. So we need to parse this data with another .on function. But this time, the event is 'end'.
				--> Here, we know that the chunks are texts, so we are using the toString() function. If its not text, we need to handle it differently.
				--> Since the 'name' property of the textbox is 'message', the parsed body of the message will contain "message=<whatever we enter in the textbox>". So we will split that by '=' and just get the second element from the array.
					---> req.on('end', () => {
					const parsedBody = buffer.concat(body).toString();
					const message = parsedBody.split('=')[1];
					fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', message);
					});
		
		+ So the entire code bokck looks like this:
			    if (myurl === '/message' && method === 'POST') {
					// create an array to store the chunks of data stream
					const body = [];
					// operate on the chunks with request's .on method
					req.on('data', (chunk) => {
						console.log(chunk);
						body.push(chunk);
					});
					// concatinate all the chunks with the Buffer object and extract the message
					req.on('end', () => { 
						console.log();
						const parsedBody = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
						const message = parsedBody.split('=')[1];
						fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', message);
					});        
					res.statusCode = 302; //status code for redirect
					res.setHeader('Location', '/'); //this 'location' is also default http stuff. setHeader is the general way to redirect
					return res.end(); //It is important to do this to avoid executing the code below
				}
				
5. Asynchronous Execution:
	- Node js executes codes asynchronously.
	- Especially for funcrtions such as the request listener which has functions within functions.
	- The req.on('end') will be queued until an end event is encountered. This will happen to all such requests and an internal registry of sorts will be maintained.
	- This is essential because sequential execution will slow the system down.
	- So in the above code, the res.statusCode and res.setHeader might get executed before the res.on('end'). This is ok as long as whatever happens within the res.on('end') does not have an effect on whatever that comes after the end event.
	- But in case this has an effect, we should put the code that comes after the req.on('end') event inside the end event itself.
	- Another solution is to have the execution return this end event. like this:
		    if (myurl === '/message' && method === 'POST') {
				// create an array to store the chunks of data stream
				const body = [];
				// operate on the chunks with request's .on method
				req.on('data', (chunk) => {
					console.log(chunk);
					body.push(chunk);
				});
				// concatinate all the chunks with the Buffer object and extract the message
				return req.on('end', () => { 
						console.log();
						const parsedBody = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
						const message = parsedBody.split('=')[1];
						fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', message);
						res.statusCode = 302; //status code for redirect
						res.setHeader('Location', '/'); //this 'location' is also default http stuff. setHeader is the general way to redirect
						return res.end(); //It is important to do this to avoid executing the code below
				});        
				
			}
    

6. fs.writeFileSync() prevents asynchronous execution.
	- This means until, the file is read and parsed, the other requests will not be processed by the system.
	- Therefore, we can use the writeFile() function. 
	- But this function takes a callback function to handle errors if any.
		+ fs.writeFile('message.txt', msg, err =>{
                res.statusCode = 302; //redirect
                res.setHeader('Location', '/'); //redirect to '/'
                return res.end();
            });
			
7. custom scripts: 
	- we can add names to run scripts instead of using npm App.js.
	- This can be donw by creating a package.json file.
	- To create a packaga.json file, we should navigate to the location of the project in terminal and run "npm init"
	- This will ask a few questions for which we should give answers. It will then create a package.json file in our project folder.
	- In the package.json file, we can modify the scripts object to add custom  names and the scripts as key value pairs.
		+ "sripts": {
					"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
					"start": "node app.js",
					"<my custom name>": "node app.js"
				  },
	- Now we can use "npm run <my custom name>" in the cmd line to run the particular script.
